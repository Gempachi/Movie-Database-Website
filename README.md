# Mini-basic-Imdb-website
The objective of movie database/website is to help users find basic viewing basic information about movies such as casting, 
ratings, directors etc. Besides displaying the ratings from popular websites such as IMDB, 
The Movie database allows user to provide feedback. The purpose for the movie database is to help user
find interesting movie easier, simplify existing site like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes etc. The movie rankings will also be based on
from the developerâ€™s point of view.
The movies on the database would be mostly targeted to college students. Although there are some movie database online,
they are not specific to university students. College students are not interested in many movies on those databases and their 
ratings do not offer much help to college students when choosing movies. Our movie database satisfies this need. Since all our project 
developers are college students, we can thus predict the movies suitable for the students.  
There will also be a search function in the website, 
where the user can search for movies, director, actors, keywords from the website and get the data accordingly.
